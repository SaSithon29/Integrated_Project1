- #### ADMIN-VIEW-ANNOUNCEMENT 
  > The page is designed to control the addition, editing, deletion, hiding, and display of notices for users.
  
    I have been working and have discovered the following : 
     - Creating a database for the announcements.
     - Creating an API endpoint for declarations.
     - Deploying the code to the development server.
     - Creating the code to display announcement details based on the structure.
     - Displaying the time zone, date, and time on the browser according to the local time zone of the open device.
